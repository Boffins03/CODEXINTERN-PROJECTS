## Project 1: Basic Data Analysis on Iris Dataset  

### Overview  
Explored the Iris dataset to demonstrate basic data analysis and visualization techniques.  
Performed EDA, descriptive statistics, and visualizations to uncover insights.  

### Key Highlights  
- Explored dataset structure, missing values, and statistics  
- Grouped by species for average feature values  
- Visualized results using bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps  
- Found strong correlation between petal length and petal width  

### Tech Stack  
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project 2: House Price Prediction using Neural Networks  

### Overview  
Built and compared two regression models using TensorFlow/Keras to predict house prices.  
The goal was to test whether activation functions improve performance.  

### Key Highlights  
- Preprocessed housing dataset (scaling, train-test split)  
- Developed two models:  
  - Model 1 → Without activation functions (linear)  
  - Model 2 → With ReLU activation functions  
- Compared results using MAE and MSE  
- Discovered that linear model (Model 1) outperformed ReLU-based model  

### Results  
| Model   | MAE       | MSE        |  
|---------|-----------|------------|  
| Model 1 | ~9,058    | ~1.21e+08  |  
| Model 2 | ~513,074  | ~3.31e+11  |  

### Tech Stack  
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project 3: Sentiment Analysis Web Application  

### Overview  
Developed a Flask-based web application for real-time sentiment analysis using TextBlob.  
The app classifies text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.  

### Key Highlights  
- User inputs text through a simple web form  
- App calculates Polarity (-1 to +1) and Subjectivity (0 to 1)  
- Clean UI with instant feedback  
- Can be extended with advanced NLP models  

### Tech Stack  
- Python, Flask, TextBlob, HTML, CSS
