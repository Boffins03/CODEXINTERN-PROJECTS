Project 2: Linear Regression Model

### Objective
Build a regression model to predict target values and evaluate its performance.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Key Tasks
- Split dataset into training and testing sets
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate using **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) and **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
- Compare model performances

### ðŸ“ˆ Results
| Model     | MAE       | MSE        |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Model 1   | 9058.80   | 1.20e+08   |
| Model 2   | 513074.25 | 3.31e+11   |

### Outcome
- Built and evaluated regression models
- Observed that Model 1 performed significantly better than Model 2 with lower error values
